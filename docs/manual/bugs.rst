Using the Trac bug tracker
============================

Bug reports regarding the UFO framework itself should be submitted via the `Trac
bug tracker`__ by choosing the ``ufo-core`` component. Anything related to
specific filter behaviour are classified under the ``ufo-filters`` component.

The Trac system also provides lists of all tickets concerning `core`_ and `filters`_.
