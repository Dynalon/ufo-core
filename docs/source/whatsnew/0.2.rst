==========================
What's New in ufo-core 0.2
==========================

Major breakage
==============

- Filters are now prefixed again with ``libfilter`` to allow introspected
  documentation. Thus, any filter built for 0.1 cannot be used because they are
  simply not found.

- :c:func:`ufo_plugin_manager_get_filter` received a new third parameter
  ``error`` that reports errors when opening and loading a UfoFilter from a
  shared object.

- The ``CHECK_ERROR`` macro defined in ``ufo-resource-manager.h`` was renamed to
  ``CHECK_OPENCL_ERROR`` to better reflect its real purpose.

- The old JSON specification has been changed to reflect the possibilities of
  the current API. Thus, JSON files that worked under Ufo 0.1 cannot be read
  with Ufo 0.2.


General improvements
====================

- Instead of the ``json/`` directory a new ``scripts/`` directory has been added
  to give an idea how to use the UFO framework for computing a tomographic
  reconstruction.

- The manual was restructured considerably.

- Saving graphs as JSON files has been added via
  :c:func:`ufo_graph_save_to_json()`.

- Filters can now wait until their properties satisfy a condition using
  :c:func:`ufo_filter_wait_until`, see also :ref:`filters-block`.
